### FAQ
<li> I clicked on "Launch IGC Console", It took me to the browser but there is some certificate/security error.

<li> I already have docker installed on my laptop, will you use existing install of docker or replace it?

We will only install Docker, if you do not have it installed or you have older Docker toolbox installed on your Mac. On Windows laptop, we do not install Docker at all. User installs Docker and come back to IGC app to install.

<li> Which versions of Windows operating system are supported for IGC Trial?

Windows 10 Enterprise

Windows 10 Professional

Windows 10 Education

<li> On Mac, I see the warning message during launch:
"IBM IGC Trial can't be opened because it is from an un-identified developer"

You would need to go to your Mac -> System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Open Anyway under Allow Apps downloaded From section. You can also refer to Mac help on this topic [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088?locale=en_US)

<li> On Windows, I see the warning during launch:


You need to click on more-info then Run Anyway to launch the app

<li> The app was successfully installed on my laptop, but IGC console or guided tutorial is not launching.

IGC Trial app requires Docker's resources to be increased to 4GB. In addition, if your laptop has only 8GB of RAM, you should check Mac's activity monitor and close some of the opened programs to free up some resources.

<li> My app installation seems to be hung with installation bar 80% for more than 20 mins.

The app installation takes no more than 15 mins on standard network download speed of 15 - 20 MBPS. A typical corporate VPN will likely limit the download speed so user must consider it while waiting to finish the install. If you loose internet connection during install, then you are advised to restart the app when connection is restored. In some cases, rebooting your laptop and restarting the app will install successfully.
